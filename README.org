* What is erlz?
  erlz is an Erlang wrapper around the FastLZ (http://www.fastlz.org)
  compression library. It's similar but not exactly the same as LZO
  compression. Both FastLZ and LZO focus on moderate compression with
  excellent decompression speed. This makes it suitable for
  high-volume uses where even moderate compression is useful.

* How do I build it?
  Simply check out the sources and type 'make'. erlz requires Erlang
  (developed against R13B04 but should also work against R14).

* Where are the docs?
  erlz has a very minimal API. Use erlz:compress/1 to compress data
  and erlz:decompress/1 to decompress.

* What license does erlz use?
  erlz is licensed under the Apache2 license. FastLZ is distributed
  under the MIT license.
